// WebView gives a `File` no path, and Tauri's own drag and drop, which would, is off (it would break the HTML drag and drop of
// the app).
// The page must never be the one to say where a file is: a path it gave (read from `text/uri-list`, typed in a message) is a path
// it could forge, and the backend would read it, and hand it to Claude, wherever it pointed. So the path is only ever read by the
// host, which keeps it, and the page holds an opaque id for the file: `attach_origin` takes that id, never a path.
// Only WebView2 (Windows) has a bridge that lets the host read the path of a `File`. Elsewhere no file has an origin: it is
// copied, as is a file the host does not know (a screenshot pasted) or one whose host fails to answer. Whatever fails gives null,
// never an error.
