//! Where a file the page hands the window lies on the disk (ESC-95, « chemin d'origine »).
//!
//! A `File` the WebView gives the page has no path, and Tauri's own drag and drop, which would give
//! it, is off (it would break the HTML drag and drop of the app). WebView2 has a way of its own: the
//! page sends its host a message with `File` objects (`chrome.webview.postMessageWithAdditionalObjects`)
//! and the host reads their paths (`ICoreWebView2File`). The page sends `{ "escouadeFileOrigin": id }`
//! with one file, then asks `file_origin(id)` for what the host read. Under Linux and macOS there is
//! no such bridge here: the command answers nothing at once, there is no path of origin, and the
//! page copies the file. A path the page would read from the drop's own data (`text/uri-list`) is
//! the page's word and no one else's: it is not one the host read, so it is never trusted.
//!
//! Only a path the host itself read may become a file joined by its path, since Escouade lets the
//! agent read such a file without asking (`AgentMeta::granted_files`): the page never gives a path
//! to `attach_origin`, only the id `file_origin` answered for. The command keeps what it answers
//! (`handed`) for that one taking (`take_handed`); an id the host read a path for and the page did
//! not ask the path of is of no use.
//!
//! The message goes to wry's own handler too, which hands it to Tauri's IPC. Tauri does not know it
//! for an invoke (`handle_ipc_message` does not find `cmd` in it) and drops it, with a
//! `console.error` in the page as its only reaction: nothing is run and nothing is answered.
